# ⚙️ SVM & SGD Implementations

This repo contains **Python implementations** of:
- **`svm.py`** – Support Vector Machine classifier
- **`sgd.py`** – Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer

Both scripts are designed for **educational purposes** to illustrate the underlying algorithms without relying on high-level black-box libraries.

## 📌 Features
- **SVM**: Linear classification with hinge loss
- **SGD**: Customizable learning rate schedule, L2 regularization
- Command-line execution with dataset loading
- Clear, commented code for learning and experimentation
